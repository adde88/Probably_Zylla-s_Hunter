Install the ProbablyEngine addon.\r\n2. Have a LUA unlocker ready.\r\n3. Install my addon to: Interface\\AddOns\\Probably_Zylla's_Rotations\\\r\n4. There should exist two important files in that folder: \"survival.lua\" and \"Probably_Zylla's_Rotations.toc\"\r\n5. Start World of Warcraft with the LUA unlocker.\r\n6. If everything is OK. ProbablyEngine AND this addon should have loaded without problems.\r\n7. Right click on the Toggle button, which is part of the ProbablyEngine addon, and load Zylla's Rotations\r\n8.
