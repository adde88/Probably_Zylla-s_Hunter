{"name":"Probably Zylla's Hunter Rotation","tagline":"A Survival Hunter Rotation addon for ProbablyEngine.","body":"**Zylla's Survival Hunter Rotation**\r\n\r\nThis is a custom addon for World of Warcraft, that depends on the ProbablyEngine addon.\r\nProbablyEngine is a \"rotation bot\" written in LUA, which this addon also is.\r\nHowever, since these addons uses protected LUA functions they CANNOT be used without a LUA unlocker!\r\nUsing a LUA unlocker is against Blizzards E.U.L.A. and can get your WoW account suspended/banned!\r\nThis may be unlikely to happen, but i don't take responsibility for anything that may happen with your account.\r\nYou have been warned!\r\n\r\n1. Install the ProbablyEngine addon.\r\n2. Have a LUA unlocker ready.\r\n3. Install my addon to: Interface\\AddOns\\Probably_Zylla's_Hunter\\\r\n4. There should exist two important files in that folder: \"survival.lua\" and \"Probably_Zylla's_Hunter.toc\"\r\n5. Start World of Warcraft with the LUA unlocker.\r\n6. If everything is OK. ProbablyEngine AND this addon should have loaded without problems.\r\n7. Right click on the Toggle button, which is part of the ProbablyEngine addon, and load Zylla's Rotation\r\n8. Start DPS'ing!\r\n\r\nCurrently only Survival Hunters are supported. But my goal is to cover all the classes and specs.\r\n\r\nPress RIGHT SHIFT to Pause the rotation\r\nExplosive Trap on mouseover when LEFT CTRL is pressed.\r\nBinding Shot on mouseover when LEFT ALT is pressed.\r\nIce Trap on mouseover when LEFT SHIFT is pressed.\r\nFreezing Trap on mouseover when RIGHT CTRL is pressed.\r\n\r\nI recommend these talents for best results:\r\n* Crouching Tiger, Hidden Chimaera\r\n* Binding Shot\r\n* Iron Hawk\r\n* Thrill of the Hunt\r\n* A Murder of Crows\r\n* Barrage\r\n* Lone Wolf\r\n\r\nI hope you have fun with this, and please give me feedback on OwnedCore forums!\r\n_http://www.ownedcore.com/forums/members/379314-adde88.html_","google":"UA-7783841-4","note":"Don't delete this file!
