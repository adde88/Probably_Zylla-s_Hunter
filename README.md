Zylla's Survival Hunter Rotation v1.0a

This is a custom addon for World of Warcraft, that depends on the ProbablyEngine addon.
ProbablyEngine is a "rotation bot" written in LUA, which this addon also is.
However, since these addons uses protected LUA functions they CANNOT be used without a LUA unlocker!
Using a LUA unlocker is against Blizzards E.U.L.A. and can get your WoW account suspended/banned!
This may be unlikely to happen, but i don't take responsibility for anything that may happen with your account.
You have been warned!

1. Install the ProbablyEngine addon.
2. Have a LUA unlocker ready.
3. Install my addon to: Interface\AddOns\Probably_Zylla's_Hunter\
4. There should exist two important files in that folder: "survival.lua" and "Probably_Zylla's_Hunter.toc"
5. Start World of Warcraft with the LUA unlocker.
6. If everything is OK. ProbablyEngine AND this addon should have loaded without problems.
7. Right click on the Toggle button, which is part of the ProbablyEngine addon, and load Zylla's Rotation
8. Start DPS'ing!

Press RIGHT SHIFT to Pause the rotation
Explosive Trap on mouseover when LEFT CTRL is pressed.
Binding Shot on mouseover when LEFT ALT is pressed.
Ice Trap on mouseover when LEFT SHIFT is pressed.
Freezing Trap on mouseover when RIGHT CTRL is pressed.

I recommend these talents:
  Crouching Tiger, Hidden Chimaera
  Binding Shot
  Iron Hawk
  Thrill of the Hunt
  A Murder of Crows
  Barrage
  Lone Wolf

I hope you can have fun with this, and please give me feedback on OwnedCore forums!
